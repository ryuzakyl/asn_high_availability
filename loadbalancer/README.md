# Simple deployement with load balancer

This docker-compose deployment launches a load balancer for allowing access to a backend web app. By default is used **Haproxy** but can be selected **Nginx** or **Traefik** just uncommenting/commenting entries in `docker-compose.yml` file

## Requeriments

Docker, docker-compose, make

## Usage

You can control the local container with ```docker-compose``` commands, i.e. up, stop, start, down, etc. however, if available, the ```make``` utility can be used to simplify usual operations.

- Build and launch containers

```bash
$ make
```
- Monitor container resources

```bash
$ make mon
```
- Build containers images

```bash
$ make build
```
- Stop and remove containers

```bash
$ make clean
```


## Options
- Each load balancer can be configured on its own config file (see load balancer folder). After editing config file, the loadbalancer must be restarted to get the new configuration, e.g. 

```bash
$ docker-compose restart haproxy
```
